A small application developed for a course in javascript

## Assignment

### Step 1. Development of 'Proof Of Concept' In this first step, we need an application that presents our courses in an attractive and modern way, giving visitors an overview of what we can offer. We also want a page where current and popular courses are presented. On the page presenting details about the course, we want the following information to be included:
- Course title
- Course number
- Number of days the course lasts
- Whether it is available as a classroom and/or distance course
- An image representing the course
- Date when the course is planned to be conducted
- An option to book the course via classroom or distance

When booking a course, the user/customer must log in or create an account. The following information should be provided on the booking page:
- Customer name
- Billing address
- Email address
- Mobile number

### Step 2. Administration Tool We need an application that allows us to add new courses. When adding new courses, we need to specify the following information:
- Course title
- Course number
- Number of days the course lasts
- Cost of the course

Additionally, we need the ability to list which customers have booked each course."
