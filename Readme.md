A small application developed for a course in javascript/typescript

## Assignment

### Step 1. Development of 'Proof Of Concept' In this first step, we need an application that presents our courses in an attractive and modern way, giving visitors an overview of what we can offer. We also want a page where current and popular courses are presented. On the page presenting details about the course, we want the following information to be included:
- Course title
- Course number
- Number of days the course lasts
- Whether it is available as a classroom and/or distance course
- An image representing the course
- Date when the course is planned to be conducted
- An option to book the course via classroom or distance

> Solultion: The popular courses is sorted by 'rating', and are displayed on the main page. On the information page, based on logged user type 'admin', 'user or null the option variates from 'Update' for admin to update info, 'Book' for user to book course (alt: 'You have booked course' if already booked) or 'Login to book course' if user is not logged in. All courses are displayed on the 'course' section when click nav button 'Kurser'.

When booking a course, the user/customer must log in or create an account. The following information should be provided on the booking page:
- Customer name
- Billing address
- Email address
- Mobile number

> Solution: The user can reach this form wither by 'Bli medlem' on the login page, or 'Logga in fÃ¶r att delta' on all the course info pages.

### Step 2. Administration Tool We need an application that allows us to add new courses. When adding new courses, we need to specify the following information:
- Course title
- Course number
- Number of days the course lasts
- Cost of the course

> Solution: The option to add acourse is presented on the 'admin' profile page where the button 'LÃ¤gg till kurs' will appear.

Additionally, we need the ability to list which customers have booked each course."
